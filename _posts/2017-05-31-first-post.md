## Sometimes, I like to blog about stuff.

I was working on a project to use Salesforce as the backend for a blog, which [went swimmingly](http://cappblog-developer-edition.na50.force.com/) by the way, and rediscovered that blogging really caters to my overbearing sense of self-importance, and also I might solve a problem, write about it, and help someone else with a similar problem. 

I'm currently an intern in a training group called CentralAPP, a sort of paid-training bootcamp where we're being taught to become Salesforce developers. Since November of 2016, we've earned Salesforce certifications for Administration and App Builder, and we're currently working toward our Platform Developer 1 certification. The goal is to retrain bright, willing people from Appalachia in new skills and technologies, and I'm lucky to be involved.
