## SFDX Is Pretty Awesome

Salesforce has released some new tooling that I've been playing with, and in particular the new command line utility sfdx. It offers a lot of features that were previously unheard of, impossible, or only available with the use of MavensMate, which is a great product, but 1st party support beats all.

If you haven't heard of this (it was news to me) I urge you to check it out:

I'm not going to be able to get much use out of this any time soon, but I was so excited that I started working on a VSCode plugin to leverage the new CLI. Its pretty limited so far, but it accomplishes the one major task I wanted out of the extension - it creates new Apex classes and Lightning resources with a couple clicks.

Its been published to the VS Marketplace, and you can check my Github for the source:
