## Breakout Clone
##### [`GitHub`](https://github.com/jbawgs/brakeowt)

Was digging around my GitHub repos and discovered a forgotten gem: a breakout clone designed and developed entirely on my phone.Even the graphics, such as they are.

I used a tool called [AIDE](http://www.android-ide.com/) for Android that allows you to develop apps on your android device and deploy them instantly. Its a great way to fill time you'd otherwise waste playing Candy Crush.

Screenshot of its gloriousness here:
