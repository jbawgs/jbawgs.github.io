# James Boggs

I'm an intern at [CentralPP Technologies](http://centralapptechnologies.com/), where we're learning to master the [Force.com](https://www.salesforce.com/) platform and related technologies. I currently hold the Salesforce Administrator Certification and the App Builder Certification, and very soon the Platform Developer 1 Certification. ![James Boggs][jb]

The purpose of this blog is to chronicle any tips, tricks, and triumphs along the way.

You can reach me at [james@vibrantd.com](mailto:james@vibrantd.com).
